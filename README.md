In 1274 BCE took place the Battle of Kadesh. There, in modern-day Syria, Egyptian and Hittite armies fought for four days with massive cost to both and no clear result. At the end of the battle, both sides claimed victory. The lack of resolution led to a years-long protracted conflict between the two empires, all the while both had more pressing issues with Egypt being raided by Libyan tribespeople and the Hittites threatened by the Assyrian Empire.

As a result, both sides agreed to sign the Treaty of Kadesh. It has the amusing distinction that, while being written in both languages, each language version claims it was the other side that came begging for peace. It is, also, the oldest recorded peace treaty.
